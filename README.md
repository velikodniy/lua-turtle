Simple program with triangle-shaped turtle controlled by program on Lua programming language.

Turtle knows only two commands: rotate(*degrees*) and move(*length*).

Program was written on Vala with Gtk+ toolkit.

Sample program:

```vala
rotate(45)
move(150);
while true do
    move(10)
    rotate(10)
end
```
